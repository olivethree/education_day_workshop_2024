## Prompts for teaching using AI

### **AI for operational efficiency**

**Prompt 1**: Act as [your name] , you are responsible for answering the following email. Please, provide a positive and friendly answer in English. Input = “[copy paste email text]”  
**Example 1 mail**: 
Subject: Inquiry Regarding AI Research Collaboration
Dear [your name],
I am a researcher at TUM and am interested in your recent work on artificial intelligence in industrial engineering. Would you be open to discussing a potential collaboration?
Best regards,  
Joe  

# AI for Co-creation: Course development

**Prompt 1**: As an example: university teacher of Psychology, provide an 8-week Masters Level course on introductory Social Cognition. Develop the learning objectives for the course. The result should be structured in a weekly format.

**Workshop example**: “Act as a university teacher of Social Cognition. Create a 4-week course on introductory Social Cognition. Develop the learning objectives for the course. The result should be structured in a weekly format.”

**Prompt 2**: Provide more detailed content per week and provide some general objectives for the whole course.

**Prompt 3**: Use Bloom’s Taxonomy to better define the objectives


### AI for Co-creation: Assessment materials  
**Prompt 1**: Act as a University teacher who is an expert in [your expertise here]. You are teaching a course on [topic(s)] to a group of [type of students]. I want you to assist me with generating exam questions. First, prompt me to choose between:  
1 - Open-ended questions  
2 - Multiple-choice questions  
Second, if I choose open-ended questions (1) ask me to specify maximum word count; and if I choose multiple-choice questions (2) ask how difficult they should be on a scale ranging from “0 = Extremely easy” to “10 = Extremely challenging”. Present the questions in a bullet list format.
Generate exam questions based on the following input: [insert input, e.g., course plan, slides, specific content]  

**Workshop example**: “Act as a University teacher who is an expert in Social Cognition. You are teaching a course on social perception and stereotype formation to a group of Psychology undergraduates. I want you to assist me with generating exam questions. First, prompt me to choose between:  
1 - Open-ended questions  
2 - Multiple-choice questions  
Second, if I choose open-ended questions (1) ask me to specify maximum word count; and if I choose multiple-choice questions (2) ask how difficult they should be on a scale ranging from “0 = Extremely easy” to “10 = Extremely challenging”. Present the questions in a bullet list format.
Generate exam questions based on the following input: [inserted course plan generated in exercise AI for Co-creation: Course development]”  

**Prompt 2**: Based on the course learning objectives, can you create a set of 6 questions, where 4 are multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty and 2 are open-ended questions? Indicate difficulty level of each question, and which one is the correct answer.  
**Prompt 3**: Explain how questions relate to learning objectives. Provide suggestions to improve them.  
**Prompt 4**: Based on the contents of the course, give 1-3 examples of what type of questions might be on the exam to students.  

# **Notes**  

•	“More balanced” setting used for most prompts in original exercise. Experiment with it and adapt to your use cases.  

•	Results will vary by default.  

•	It is important to evaluate and refine the output – AI is merely a facilitator and its output should always be scrutinized. An expert human in the loop is a crucial element in this type of collaboration.  



# Bonus: Create an AI assistant for research tasks

Try it out using Copilot, upload one article you know well.  
This prompt uses spacing between sections, these help the model better understand the separate elements of its instructions, leading to less misunderstandings.

## Prompt: AI Paper Summary Generator

---Role---  
Act as an expert in education of scientific writing and academic skills in general. You are very good at identifying the core requirements to write excellent articles and which strategies are best to teach academic writing skills  
  
---Task---  
Input: 
The input will be a uploaded document of a scientific article (throw a warning if no document was uploaded)  
Task:  
I want you to critically analyze the uploaded article. Create a summary of key points of the article. Create an overview of the paper at the end focusing on the main take away message. In addition, list potentially interesting questions that are opened by the paper.  
Output  
Start by creating a reference for the article in both APA 7th styIe and IEEE style; include the DOI or a link to the article webpage. To achieve this goal, search the web for the link and the DOI, for instance by using Google Scholar or similar sources. It is okay if you do not find anything, but inform me that you did not find anything when it happens.
